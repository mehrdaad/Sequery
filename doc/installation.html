<H2><A NAME="Intro"></A>Introduction</H2>

<P><I>Sequery</i> is a tool to search the sequences of the protein
   structures in the <a href="http://www.pdb.bnl.gov">Protein Data
   Bank</a> (PDB) for a particular pattern of residues, which may
   include exact matches and acceptable substitutions based on a
   user-specified amino acid substitution matrix and/or a numerical
   threshold. <I>Sequery</i> was developed by Michael E. Pique,
   Michael A. Siani, Leslie A. Kuhn, Elizabeth D. Getzoff, and John
   A. Tainer, <A href="http://www.scripps.edu/mb">Department of
   Molecular Biology</a>, <A href="http://www.scripps.edu">The Scripps
   Research Institute</a> and is distributed here with permission of
   the authors. Development of <I>Sequery</i> was supported in part by
   NSF grant BIR9631436.</P>


<P>A useful complement to <I>Sequery</i> is <I>SSA</i>
   (Superpositional Structure Assignment), which automates the
   assignment of secondary structure to tetrapeptides identified by a
   <I>Sequery</i> search. For more information and software
   availability, see <A href="../ssa/doc.html"><I>SSA</i> Information and
   Documentation</a>.</P>

<P>For literature references related to <I>Sequery</I>, please see the
      section on <A HREF="#Det">Algorithmic Details</A>.</P>

<P>Usage information for <I>Sequery</i> can be found in <a
	href="use.html">Using <i>Sequery</i></a></P>

<H2><A NAME="Install"></A>Getting and Installing <I>Sequery</I></H2>

<P><I>Sequery</i> will work on any UNIX system with a C-compiler and
has been tested on Sun hardware running Solaris and SGI hardware
running Irix. Additional scripts require awk, C-shell (csh) and
Bourne-shells (sh) installed, as well as an accessible copy of the
Protein Data Bank.</P>

<P>The latest version of <I>Sequery</I>, as well as the most recent
      version of this documentation, can be found at the home page for
      the <A
      HREF="http://www.bch.msu.edu/labs/kuhn/index.html">Protein
      Structural Analysis and Design Laboratory</A>, <A
      HREF="http://www.bch.msu.edu/">Department of Biochemistry,
      Michigan State University</A>, and is distributed here with
      permission of the co-authors at The Scripps Research Institute,
      Michael Pique, Elizabeth Getzoff, and John Tainer. To install
      <I>Sequery</I>, perform the following steps:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Download <A
	  HREF="http://www.bch.msu.edu/labs/kuhn/web/software/sequery/sequery.tar.Z">sequery.tar.Z
	  </A></LI>	 

<LI>Place this file in the directory into which you wish to install the
	software, and enter the following command:</LI>

<UL>
<P><TT>zcat sequery.tar.Z | tar xvf -</TT></P>
</UL>

<LI>To compile the software, type the following command from the directory
      in which <I>Sequery</I> was unpacked:</LI>

<UL>
<LI><TT>make install</TT><BR> 
    (Note: This defaults to using the current directory as the root
    directory for <I>Sequery</i>. If this is not desired, alter the
    makefile to include the desired location where noted in the
    makefile. Also, if <I>Sequery</i> is later moved from this
    location, it will need to be recompiled to work correctly.)
</UL>
<P>
      <LI>There are a few additional modifications that must be made
	in some of the scripts in <tt>sequery/share</tt> to point to
	the correct file and directory locations. These locations will
	be specific to your system. All settings are at
	the top of the script code. The scripts and variable settings
	needed are as follows:<P>
	<table border=1 cellpadding=5>
	  <tr>
	    <th valign=top>Script Name</th>
	    <th valign=top>Variable to Set at the<BR>
      top of the script</th>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	    <td valign=top><tt>addname</tt></td>
	    <td valign=top><tt>PDBHOME</tt></td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	    <td valign=top><tt>genpdbselectseq</tt></td>
	    <td valign=top><tt>PDBHOME</tt><br>
	      <tt>SEQUERY_HOME</tt></td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	    <td valign=top><tt>minipdbextract</tt></td>
	    <td valign=top><tt>PDBHOME</tt></td>
	  </tr>
      </table><P>
	The <tt>PDBHOME</tt> variable should be set to the
	directory of the Protein Data Bank files (e.g. /usr/pdb)<br>
	The <tt>SEQUERY_HOME</tt> variable should be set to
	the directory in which <i>Sequery</i> was installed
	(e.g. /usr/bin/sequery)

<H3><A NAME="Shells"></A>Troubleshooting Shell Scripts</H3>

<P>Located in the <TT>Sequery/share</tt> directory are several shell
      scripts, all of which assume the C-shell and Bourne-shell are
      installed in the standard locations, which are <tt>/bin/csh</tt>
      and <tt>/bin/sh</tt>. If you have difficulty
      running one or more of these scripts, you may edit the first
      line of each script to point to the correct shell location for
      your system. <I>Sequery</I> scripts which are dependent on shell
      locations include:</P>
 
<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=4 >
<TR>
<TH>Script</TH><TH>Shell</TH>
</TR>
 
<TR>
<TD><TT>addname</TT></TD><TD><TT>/bin/sh</TT></TD>
</TR>
 
<TR>
<TD><TT>genpdbselectseq</TT></TD><TD><TT>/bin/sh</TT></TD>

</TR>

<TR>
<TD><TT>minipdbextract</TT></TD><TD><TT>/bin/csh</TT></TD>
</TR>

</TABLE>

<P>Additionally, these scripts assume you have <TT>awk</tt>,
   <TT>nawk</tt>, or <TT>gawk</tt> (different implementations of a
   simple column- or field-oriented programming language) running on
   your system. (See <A href="http://www.gnu.org/">The Free Software
   Foundation (GNU) web site</a> for more information on
   obtaining and using <TT>gawk</tt>.)

<H2><A NAME="Tools"></A>Other Scripts and Tools Provided with
<I>Sequery</I></H2>
    Included in the <tt>sequery/share</tt> directory are a few
    additional tools that may be of use and are described below. These
    scripts must be modified upon installation to point to the correct
    directories. See <A href="#Install">Getting and Installing
      <I>Sequery</i></a> above for more information. Further
    information on their use can be found in <a
      href="use.html#Tools">Using <i>Sequery</i></a>
<UL>

      <LI>addname -- adds protein name from the PDB file to end of
	<I>Sequery</i> output line. Output to stdout. This is useful
        for noting functional patterns in the proteins that match.<P>
      <LI>genpdbselectseq -- generates a sequence file which contains
	the amino acid sequences along with PDB codes, and chain IDs
	and which is used by <I>Sequery</i> to search for pattern
	matches, for each of the PDB files in the PDB Select list.<P>
      <LI>genpdbseq -- generates a sequence file as a <I>Sequery</i>
	search database from a
	PDB file or series of PDB files. Output is directed to stdout.<P>
      <LI>minipdbextract -- generates a PDB formatted file for the
	residues in each line of <i>Sequery</i> output. It takes the
	start residue, end residue, and pdbcode from <tt>Sequery</tt>
	output, searches the <tt>$PDBHOME</tt> database for that
	protein, and extracts coordinate lines from the PDB files.<P>
